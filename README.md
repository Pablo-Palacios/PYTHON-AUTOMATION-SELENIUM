Hi, this is a project to create automations for logging into the Flow and Twitter pages. 
In this case, I use Python to perform the automations with the Selenium library, connected to a Chrome driver.
For the Flow page, I conduct multiple tests for different events, such as connecting with HTTP or creating a view for the home page of Flow. 
Then, I create tests to ensure a smooth login process for the page. 
I use pytest with the 'html' commands to initialize all the tests in one go and save all the results in an HTML page.
